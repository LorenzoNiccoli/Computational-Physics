# Armonic oscillator: symplectic and non-symplectic Euler map
# 
# Parameters:
#     x       -   starting position             [m]
#     p       -   starting momentum             [m/s]
#     w       -   frequency of the oscillation  [1/s]
#     dt      -   time step                     [s]
#     Nsteps  -   number of steps
#
# Outputs:
#     x1n     -   collection of the position over time  [m]
#     p1n     -   collection of the momenta over time   [m/s]
#
# Notes: 
#     1. This code has been made with a didattical reason in mind, thus it is not the
#        most perfoning way to solve the problem of the harmonic oscillator.
