# Computational Physics – Personal Study

This repository contains simple computational physics codes created for personal study and learning, in a kind of 'learning in public' approach.  
The focus is on understanding numerical methods rather than optimising performance.  

Included examples:  
*  Harmonic Oscillator – symplectic and non-symplectic methods.  
*  Lotka–Volterra Equations – solving predator-prey dynamics with ODEs.  
*  Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) – solving standard physics ODEs (Newton cooling equation) 
*  Monte Carlo Estimation of π – approximating π using random sampling.
