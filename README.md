# Computational-Physics
This repository contains basic codes that solve some common problems encountered in computational physics. 
They serve as a tutorial with not intent to be the most performing solutions, ranging from classical problems to Molecular Dynamics.                      

Problems:
1. Harmonic Oscillator (sympletic and non sympletic map)    -   
2. Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations                                 -
