# Computational-Physics
This repository contains basic codes that solve some common problems encountered in computational physics. 
They serve as a tutorial with not intent to be the most performing solutions.         

Problems:
1. Harmonic Oscillator (sympletic and non sympletic map)      
2. Lotka–Volterra equations
3. Evaluation of π via Monte Carlo method
