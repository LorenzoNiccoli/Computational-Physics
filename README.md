##Computational Physics – Personal Study

This repository contains simple computational physics codes created for personal study and learning. 
The focus is on understanding numerical methods rather than performance optimization.  

Included examples:  
Harmonic Oscillator – symplectic and non-symplectic methods.  
Lotka–Volterra Equations – solving predator-prey dynamics with ODEs.  
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) – solving standard physics ODEs.  
Monte Carlo Estimation of π – approximating π using random sampling.
